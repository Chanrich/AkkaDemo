Akka is built to make distributed, concurrent system design easier.
Developers can focus more on the design instead of dealing with locking and thread management.

Akka's actor model is based on asynchronous message passing. Each actor has exactly 1 mailbox that enqueues messages for this actor.
The order of messages received that were sent at the same time by different actors are not guaranteed. However, order is in tact for message sent by same single actor.

With the actor model, tasks can be split up small enough and distribute to child actors.
For every child actor, there will be one parent actor to supervise its state. The supervisor are responsible to terminate child actor when things go south.
